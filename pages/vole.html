        <p id="gopher"> Voles can cause numerous and extensive damages to the properties they infest.  Some of these hazards include an increased risk of personal injury by creating uneven and unstable ground which can result in liability issues, the rapid mass consumption and destruction of ornamental plants, trees, and gardens, destruction of plumbing and utility lines from "girdling", and unsightly visual damage to the landscape. Voles will consume an astounding 60% of their body weight daily and multiply rapidly via an incredible reproductive rate, which can turn a small problem into a massive outbreak in a short time. </p>

        <p id="gopher"> Animal Damage Management provides multiple options for vole control. We can use rodenticide baits, kill traps and we can exclude them from your property using a combination of above-ground and underground screening. Our prices will differ depending on the method chosen, the amount of activity present, and the size of the area to be controlled. We guarantee all vole work we perform. Please call us so we can setup an appointment for you to meet with one of our fully trained technicians or supervisors. </p>

<h3> Quick Facts! </h3>
<ul class="fix">
  <li >  Vole Dangers: Voles should never harm a human directly. The damage from moles comes from runway systems becoming tripping hazards and voles being disease vectors. </li>
  <li  > Vole Food: Voles are massive consumers of whatever they come into contact with. Voles will eat 60% of their body weight a day. Voles also have teeth similar to a beavers and they constantly need to file them down. This causes them to girdle on bark which often kills the plant/tree. </li>
  <li  > Vole Habitat: Voles inhabit all of North and South America, Europe and Asia. Here in California we have a variety of species that live from Sierra Nevada Mountains to the San Diego Coast. Typically moles are found in low lying areas that retain moisture. </li>
  <li> How We Work : You would simple give us a call or an email and one of our technicians will come out to the site and give you a free quote for the service. If you would like to proceed we would then use the selected control method to eliminate the problem.</li>

        <p id="gopher"> Gophers can cause numerous and extensive damages to the properties they infest.  Some of these hazards include an increased risk of personal injury due to uneven ground/burrows which can result in liability issues, slope failure due to undermining the structural integrity of hillsides,  the consumption of ornamental plants or gardens, and unsightly visual damage to the landscape. </p>

        <p id="gopher"> Animal Damage Management provides multiple options for gopher control. We can use rodenticide baits, live or kill traps and we can exclude them from your property using underground screening. Our prices will differ depending on the method chosen, the amount of activity present, and the size of the area to be controlled. We guarantee all gopher work we perform. Please call us so we can setup an appointment for you to meet with one of our fully trained technicians or supervisors. </p>

<h1> Comprehending Gophers</h1>
<h3> Signs  </h3>
<p id="solution1"> Gophers leave mounds of dirt in a horseshoe shaped pattern wherever they are creating tunnel systems. Gophers are serious consumers of vegetative matter so an easy to spot sign of gopher damage is the dying off or wilting of plants/trees or the complete disappearance of small plants. </p>

<h3> Quick Facts! </h3>
<ul class="fix">
  <li > Gopher Dangers: Gophers should never harm a human directly. The damage from gophers comes from mound systems becoming tripping hazards or slope failure. </li>
  <li  > Gopher Food: Gophers consume all vegetative plant matter. They will eat the above ground parts of a plant but typically they feed on the root structure of plants. </li>
  <li  > Gopher Habitat: Gophers inhabit all of North and South America. Here in California we have the California pocket gopher and it is native throughout the state from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the San Diego Coast. </li>
  <li> How We Work : You would simple give us a call or an email and one of our technicians will come out to the site and give you a free quote for the service. If you would like to proceed we would then use the selected control method to eliminate the problem.</li>

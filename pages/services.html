          <h4> Animal Problems? </h4>
          <p>Animals are an important part of our environment, and contribute to the beauty of our world in the proper wild settings. However, wildlife can become destructive pests when invading populated regions, causing damage to landscaped areas, homes and other structures, and commonly contribute to erosion, slope failure and water loss. Additionally, many wildlife species carry zoonotic disease which can spread to humans and our animal pets, such as: Bubonic Plague, Murine Typhus, Rabies, Histoplasmosis, Salmonella (food poisoning), Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever and others.</p>

        <h5> A Unique, Affordable, and Effective Approach to Stopping Gopher Damage </h5>
        <p> Time and again, Smith’s Gopher Trapping Service receive calls from folks who are frustrated with the poor results they get from using pest control companies when they need to get rid of gophers and moles from the garden.</p>

          <p>And that’s completely understandable, because gopher elimination or removal requires a different set of skills than most pest control companies have.  What’s more, the best way to stop gophers is to use traps — not poison (gas and poison baits are much less effective than trapping, cost more in the long run, and poisons are toxic to wildlife).</p>

          <p>And that’s good news, especially for those who are adverse to the use of toxins around their home, office, and schools (We’re Healthy Schools Act exempt!) </p>

          <h5> The Benefits of Trapping Gophers vs. Using Poisons </h5>
          <p> Apart from safety concerns, Smith’s pest control services use trapping to get rid of gophers from your property for a number of reasons. In fact, trapping: </p>
          <li> Works faster </li>
          <li> Is less expensive </li>
          <li> Has no side effects on the environment </li>

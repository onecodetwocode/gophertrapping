        <p id="gopher"> Moles can cause numerous and extensive damages to the properties they infest.  Some of these hazards include an increased risk of personal injury due to uneven ground/burrows which can result in liability issues, the destruction of ornamental plants by diverting water-flow into the tracks of their underground feeding tunnels,  and unsightly visual damage to the landscape. </p>

        <p id="gopher"> Animal Damage Management provides multiple options for mole control. We can use rodenticide baits, live or kill traps and we can exclude them from your property using underground screening. Our prices will differ depending on the method chosen, the amount of activity present, and the size of the area to be controlled. We guarantee all mole work we perform. Please call us so we can setup an appointment for you to meet with one of our fully trained technicians or supervisors. </p>

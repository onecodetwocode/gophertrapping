        <p id="gopher"> Ground Squirrels can cause numerous and extensive damages to the properties they infest.  Some of these hazards include the infestation of ectoparasites such as fleas around ground squirrel burrows and colonies, an increased risk of personal injury due to uneven ground/burrows which can result in liability issues, slope failure due to undermining the structural integrity of hillsides,  the consumption of ornamental plants or gardens, destruction of plumbing and utility lines from chewing, and unsightly visual damage to the landscape. </p>

        <p id="gopher"> Animal Damage Management provides multiple options for ground squirrel control. We can use rodenticide baits, live or kill traps and we can exclude them from your property using underground screening. Our prices will differ depending on the method chosen, the amount of activity present, and the size of the area to be controlled. We guarantee all ground squirrel work we perform. Please call us so we can setup an appointment for you to meet with one of our fully trained technicians or supervisors. </p>

<h3> Quick Facts! </h3>
<ul class="fix">
  <li >  Ground Squirrel Dangers: Ground Squirrels should never harm a human directly. The damage from Ground Squirrels comes from mound systems becoming tripping hazards, slope failure, undermining building foundations and being a major disease vector. </li>
  <li  > Ground Squirrel Food: Ground Squirrels consume all vegetative plant matter and will consume different types of meat. They tend to eat anything within their feeding range and will consume pet food as well. </li>
  <li  > Ground Squirrel Habitat: Gophers inhabit all of North and South America. Here in California we have the California pocket gopher and it is native throughout the state from the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the San Diego Coast. </li>
  <li> How We Work : You would simple give us a call or an email and one of our technicians will come out to the site and give you a free quote for the service. If you would like to proceed we would then use the selected control method to eliminate the problem.</li>

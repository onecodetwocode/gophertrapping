    <p> <img class="align-left medium"src=images/zach.png> A professional gardener by trade, Zachary Smith founded “Smith’s Gopher Trapping Service” after long and frustrating (and ultimately unproductive) search for a excellent gopher control service. Zachary leaned to get rid of gophers so well that he began to help other local gardeners eliminate their moles, ground squirrels and gophers from lawns and landscapes too. A professional horticulturist who holds a BS in Environmental Horticultural Science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Zach also holds a number of trade certifications, including a State Trapper’s License, Qualified Applicator’s License (QAL), and a State Pest Control Business License. It is a little known fact that these licenses are required by the State of California to trap nuisance wildlife. A Bay Area native, when not at work, Zach enjoys spending time with his family cycling, hiking, and taking road trips. State licensed and insured to eliminate pests on residential and commercial properties, as well as schools and parks, the Smith’s Team has extensive experience getting rid of gopher, mole, and ground squirrel problems.

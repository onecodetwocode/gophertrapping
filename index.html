    <h1> Meet The Owner </h1>
    <p id="zach"> <img class="align-left medium" src=images/zach.png> A professional gardener by trade, Zachary Smith founded “Smith’s Gopher Trapping Service” after long and frustrating (and ultimately unproductive) search for a excellent gopher control service. Zachary leaned to get rid of gophers so well that he began to help other local gardeners eliminate their moles, ground squirrels and gophers from lawns and landscapes too. A professional horticulturist who holds a BS in Environmental Horticultural Science from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Zach also holds a number of trade certifications, including a State Trapper’s License, Qualified Applicator’s License (QAL), and a State Pest Control Business License. It is a little known fact that these licenses are required by the State of California to trap nuisance wildlife. A Bay Area native, when not at work, Zach enjoys spending time with his family cycling, hiking, and taking road trips. State licensed and insured to eliminate pests on residential and commercial properties, as well as schools and parks, the Smith’s Team has extensive experience getting rid of gopher, mole, and ground squirrel problems.

     <i class="yelp"> Alfredo, from Smith's is a more recent employee and he's determined to do the best job possible.  He arrived and set more than 20 traps where there was obvious gopher activity. When he returned week later, we had a gopher!  After 4 total visits we determined that the 3 kills we got did the job.  It's clear that there can be many holes, but not necessarily many gophers. Alfredo is conscientious and personable and deserves my trust and confidence.  Thanks to Smith's for sending him to me!</i>

Couldn't believe the damage one mole did to our landscaping in a week. Javier was great. 14 traps and shortly thereafter the problem was eradicated. I would absolutely use them again!</i>

         <i class="yelp"> I hired Smith's to help me out with a rat problem in my outdoor shed. They were great. I didn't want poison because I have animals and care about the environment. Rat poison does kill rats who are eaten by birds of prey etc.and affect the whole food chain. Mike came out and set traps and captured twelve very healthy rats (feeding on my fruit trees) and took them away. The cost is very reasonable.</i>
